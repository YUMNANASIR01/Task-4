# Hackathon Day #04 Tasks 🚀

## Key Tasks 📋

### 1. Understanding & Testing API Endpoints 🌐

- **Familiarize** with API documentation to understand available endpoints, expected inputs, and outputs.
- **Test** endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL to validate functionality.
- **Verify** responses and identify potential issues such as incorrect data types, missing fields, or improper status codes.
- **Visualize** the API calling process through a flowchart, detailing client requests, server responses, and error handling.

### 2. Designing & Implementing Data Schemas in Sanity CMS 📦

- **Define** robust structures that align with project goals, ensuring scalability and flexibility.
- **Use** Sanity schema builder to create content types tailored to frontend requirements.
- **Include** fields for critical data points like product details, user profiles, and order history, along with validation rules to maintain data integrity.

### 3. Migrating Data from APIs to Sanity CMS 🔄

- **Extract** data from external sources while respecting API rate limits and data licensing.
- **Transform** the extracted data to match Sanity schemas using scripts or middleware.
- **Import** transformed data into Sanity CMS using tools like Sanity CLI or custom scripts.

### 4. Handling API Responses & Errors 🚧

- **Implement** error handling using try-catch blocks to manage runtime issues gracefully.
- **Log** errors systematically to monitoring systems or logging services.
- **Handle** common scenarios such as timeouts, invalid inputs, authentication failures, and rate limits. Provide user-friendly feedback for recoverable errors.

### 5. Aligning Data with Marketplace Goals 🎯

- **Review** data for compatibility with marketplace features like search, filtering, and personalization.
- **Adjust** schemas and data as needed to accommodate new features or changing requirements.
- **Ensure** consistency across the platform by validating data integrity and relationships.

## API Methods & Database Interaction 🗄️

Below is an illustration of how data can be managed in the database using four HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

![HTTP Methods Illustration](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=HTTP+Methods+Diagram)

1. **GET**: Retrieve data from the database (e.g., fetching user information or product details).
2. **POST**: Add new data to the database (e.g., creating a new order or user profile).
3. **PUT**: Update existing data (e.g., modifying user information or product inventory).
4. **DELETE**: Remove data from the database (e.g., deleting an order or a user account).

## Day 4: Building Dynamic Frontend Components 🧩

### Objective

Design modular, responsive components to display marketplace data fetched from Sanity CMS or APIs, prioritizing clean architecture and scalability.

### Key Learnings 🌟

1. Build components that efficiently consume and display data.
2. Apply modularity for reusable and maintainable code.
3. Use state management libraries to handle data flows.
4. Design with a mobile-first, responsive approach.
5. Follow professional workflows, including version control and peer reviews.

### Components to Build 🛠️

1. **Product Grid**:

   - Display name, price, and image in a grid layout.
   - Ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes.

2. **Product Detail**:

   - Use dynamic routes in Next.js to fetch and display detailed product info.
   - Include descriptions, prices, sizes, and images.

3. **Category**:

   - Create dynamic category pages with filtering options.

4. **Search Bar**:

   - Implement a search feature that filters products by name or tags.

5. **Cart**:

   - Manage items in the cart, including quantity and total price.
   - Use state management for real-time updates.

6. **Wishlist**:

   - Save and retrieve favorite items using local storage or state management.

7. **Checkout Flow**:

   - Design a multi-step form for shipping, payment, and review.

8. **Profile**:

   - Display user details such as order history and preferences.

9. **Reviews**:

   - Enable users to leave feedback and ratings for products.

10. **Pagination**:

    - Implement pagination for handling large datasets efficiently.

## Debugging Tools 🔧

### Tools for Components

- **Browser DevTools**: Inspect elements, monitor network requests, and debug JavaScript.
- **Console Logs**: Trace code execution and debug state changes.
- **React Developer Tools**: Inspect and modify component state and props during development.

### Testing Routing

- Validate dynamic paths and ensure correct data fetching for each route.

---

## Documentation & Submission 📝

### Professional Documentation

- Document processes, issues encountered, and solutions applied.
- Include diagrams and screenshots for clarity.

### Mock Data

- Use mock data to test features when APIs are unavailable.

### Submission Format

- Host code on a public GitHub repository with clear setup and usage instructions.

---

## FAQs ❓

### 1. Should all components be built?

No, but implementing additional features enhances the project and demonstrates advanced skills.

### 2. Can external libraries be used?

Yes, libraries like Tailwind CSS or Chart.js are recommended for efficiency.

### 3. Facing issues with Sanity?

Check API keys, dataset configurations, and ensure the schema matches the expected data structure.
